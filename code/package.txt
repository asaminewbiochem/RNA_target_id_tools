Packages in Python
A package is a hierarchical file directory structure that defines a single Python application
environment that consists of modules and subpackages and sub-subpackages, and so on.
Consider a file Pots.py available in Phone directory. This file has the following line of
source code-
#!/usr/bin/python3
def Pots():
print ("I'm Pots Phone")
Similarly, we have other two files having different functions with the same name as above.
They are −
 Phone/Isdn.py file having function Isdn()
 Phone/G3.py file having function G3()
Now, create one more file __init__.py in the Phone directory-
 Phone/__init__.py
To make all of your functions available when you have imported Phone, you need to put
explicit import statements in __init__.py as followsfrom
followsfrom
Pots import Pots
from Isdn import Isdn
from G3 import G3
After you add these lines to __init__.py, you have all of these classes available when you
import the Phone package.
#!/usr/bin/python3
# Now import your Phone Package.
import Phone
Phone.Pots()
Phone.Isdn()
Phone.G3()
