# Monte Carlo Reweight Dihedral Force Constant

This Python script implements Monte Carlo reweighting of dihedral force constants, primarily for molecular dynamics simulations. The code has been updated for Python 3 compatibility and improved practices.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the script using Python 3 with the required command-line arguments.
   
   ```bash
   python3 monte_carlo_reweight.py <run> <thread> <jobid> <f>
   ```

   - `<run>`: Integer representing the run number.
   - `<thread>`: Number of threads to use for parallel execution.
   - `<jobid>`: Integer representing the job ID.
   - `<f>`: String representing the filename.

2. **Input Files**: Ensure the necessary input files are available, including parameters (`parm.parm`), QM data (`<f>.qm`), and CHARMM scripts (`charmm.<jobid>.sh`).

3. **Output**: The script generates parameter files with optimized parameters (`optimized.<f>.<run>.str`) and intermediate parameter files during each iteration of the Monte Carlo simulation.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- `mcsa_module` (Assumed to be updated for Python 3 compatibility)
- CHARMM (for molecular dynamics simulations)

## Details

- The script performs Monte Carlo simulations to optimize dihedral force constants based on a target function, using NMR data.
- It utilizes multi-threading to speed up the optimization process.
- Intermediate parameter files (`tmp.<jobid>.<f>.<run>.<thread>.<istep>.str`) are generated for each iteration of the simulation.
- The best parameter set (`optimized.<f>.<run>.str`) is saved with the lowest RMSE value.
- Execution time is displayed at the end of the script.
